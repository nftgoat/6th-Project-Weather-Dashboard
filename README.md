# 6th-Project-Weather-Dashboard

## What I did in this project
In this project I code a weather dashboard from scratch. This weather dashboard gives anyone the ability to search the weather of any given city at any point in time. This is all possible thanks to 3rd Party APIs.

## What I learned from this project
This project gave me some great perspective on just how powerful the usage of APIs can really be. It also helped me grasp the usage of Javascript and jQuery even more. I am truly amazed by the power that 3rd party APIs offer.
